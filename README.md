Almost to nothing to see here.

# CustomGamingUI
A program written in Python that overlays widgets on top of the screen. They can also read from the screen using magic of OCR.



## A bit of backstory
It all started in July 2023. I was playing a roblox game called Dummies Vs. Noobs, and I noticed I couldn't handle the bow very well. After some time spent I made a program that overlays custom crosshair(i didnt know anything else existed). I'm now playing without it because I already kinda reached the limit of skill. 2 months forward I was assigned to make a project using PyQT5 in IT lyceum. And remembering last thing I made I decided to create this. I took the UI inspiration while playing on Android Emulator, MEmu specifically. There's an option to add custom widgets that tap on the specific screen location based on your keypresses. I don't really know if anyone else made the same idea I did, and I know I'm not the first, so please tell me if you find a simmilar.
Simmilar programs I've found so far: CrossOver by lacymorrow.

## Usage
I tried to make the UI as intuitive as possible. The concept of linking nodes is simillar to programs like Blender and Scratch(I only remember that XD). There are tips and a tutorial if you still need help.

## Feedback
If you notice any bugs or crashes while using the program, please tell me. I really want to polish this project and I won't let it go to waste.
